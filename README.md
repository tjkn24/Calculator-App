# Calculator-App
from Udemy course by Bita Mirshafiee.

I modified her code to fix the following bugs:
1. Eo enable the result of a calculation to be used as first operand of the next calculation
2. To reset operator flag to false after pressing button_equal so that in the next calculation operator function match with pressed operator button
3. to check if a string is a valid number to prevent app crash when pressing operator or equal buttons
